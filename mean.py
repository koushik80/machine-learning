#Mean:
#The mean value is the average value.

#To calculate the mean, find the sum of all values, and divide the sum by the number of values:

#(99+86+87+88+111+86+103+87+94+78+77+85+86) / 13 = 89.77

#Example
#Use the NumPy mean() method to find the average speed:

import numpy

speed = [99, 86, 87, 88, 111, 86, 103, 87, 94, 78, 77, 85, 86]

x = numpy.mean(speed)

print(x)
